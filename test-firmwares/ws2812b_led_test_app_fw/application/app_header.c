/*
 * Application Header for EngEmil STM32 Bootloader Integration
 * 
 * This file defines the application header structure that must be
 * placed at 0x08004000 (start of application flash region).
 * 
 * The bootloader validates this header before jumping to the application:
 * - Checks magic number (0xDEADBEEF)
 * - Validates firmware size
 * - Verifies CRC32 checksum
 * 
 * The size and crc32 fields are automatically signed by the
 * sign_app_header script during the build process.
 * 
 * The usb_vid and usb_pid fields are used by the bootloader in DFU mode.
